## 1. Good Data Visualisation
We have already learned from our previous data visualisation tutorials what makes a good plot. A quick recap on the main points:
1. Appropriate plot type for results
2. Plot is well organised
3. X and Y axis are easy to read and have the correct units
4. Clear and informative legend

## 2. Are interactive plots that much better?

You may be asking yourself, why I am putting myself through more coding when I already know how to make plots using the ggplot2 package? That is because interactive plots are amazing in visualising data in a way that is really engaging.

Interactive plots invite people to actively explore the data being presented to them rather than just looking at a static image. This helps with retention of what the plot is explaining as non-expert audiences can filter and custom the image and build their understanding.

The one downside of interactive plots its that they are not appropriate for academic papers but they are commonly used for online websites and newspapers. So lets get started and learn how to make them!

## 3. Introduction to `Plotly` package

This tutorial will consist on learning how to make interactive plots using the `Plotly` package. The `Plotly` package utilities the power of Plotly.js, a popular JavaScript library for interactive plotting, and allow us to use R to create customisable, interactive, web-based visualisations.

Some key features of this package:
- Interactive plots: zoom, pan and hover features, with clickable legends and data point selection.
- Wide range of plot types: can create any of the basic plots (scatter, barcharts, histograms) as well as more advanced and specialised plots(choropleths, 3D scatter plots, financial charts).
- It works well with other common R packages such as `ggplot2`, `dplyr` or `shiny`.
- It outputs plots that are HTML and web compatible: 
- Cross-language compatibility: Though it uses R, the underlying Plotly.js library ensures that visualizations are consistent across Python, JavaScript, and R.

This is a short summary of what this package can do but if you are curoius on the extent on what this package can do, head over to their website.

During this tutorial will be using `Plotly` to create several scatter plots, bar charts and choropleths and at the same time learning the basic functions of this amazing package.

## 3. Scatter plots
As everyone know, before we even start we need to load our libraries!

```r
#*Loading libraries*
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

#*install.packages("plotly")*
library(plotly)
```



You can add more text and code, e.g.

```r
# Create fake data
x_dat <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 5, sd = 2)  # x data
y_dat <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 10, sd = 0.2)  # y data
xy <- data.frame(x_dat, y_dat)  # combine into data frame
```

Here you can add some more text if you wish.

```r
xy_fil <- xy %>%  # Create object with the contents of `xy`
	filter(x_dat < 7.5)  # Keep rows where `x_dat` is less than 7.5
```

And finally, plot the data:

```r
ggplot(data = xy_fil, aes(x = x_dat, y = y_dat)) +  # Select the data to use
	geom_point() +  # Draw scatter points
	geom_smooth(method = "loess")  # Draw a loess curve
```

At this point it would be a good idea to include an image of what the plot is meant to look like so students can check they've done it right. Replace `IMAGE_NAME.png` with your own image file:

More text, code and images.

This is the end of the tutorial. Summarise what the student has learned, possibly even with a list of learning outcomes. In this tutorial we learned:

##### - how to generate fake bivariate data
##### - how to create a scatterplot in ggplot2
##### - some of the different plot methods in ggplot2

We can also provide some useful links, include a contact form and a way to send feedback.
